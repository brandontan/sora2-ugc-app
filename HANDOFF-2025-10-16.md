**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Hardened Fal webhook handler to capture nested payload video URLs (`status: OK`) and backfilled missing video link for job `f6ab9c07-0d81-48d7-a888-8c88e028f3b8`.
  - Refreshed dashboard UX: active/history job tabs, tray scroll bounds, shortened filenames, immediate asset preview toggles, and first/last-frame thumbnail strip.
  - Logged every webhook payload into `public.job_webhooks` and confirmed refunds fire automatically on 422 content-policy failures.
  - Deployed fixes to production (`sora2-ugc-app-clean-*`), verified Vercel build success, and replayed Fal webhook to confirm video persistence.
  - Topped up Fal with $50 (â‰ˆ45 runs at launch pricing) and drafted marketing copy for Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn.
- In progress:
  - Monitoring live runs (Sora content-policy defaults, Veo queue latency) and credit ledger sync; watching for webhook signature support as a follow-up.
- Blockers:
  - Fal content policy can still reject certain Sora prompts; no automation beyond surfacing message + refund.
- Decisions:
  - Stay pay-per-run (no subscription). Keep webhook signature verification as next hardening task post-launch.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Launch monitoring + ensuring Fal webhook/video persistence across all models (Sora 2, Veo fast, Veo first/last).
- Next immediate task: Watch queue + ledger metrics as traffic arrives; queue webhook signature hardening for next work block.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = danger-full-access
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Confirm all three model modes (Sora, Veo single, Veo first/last) deliver MP4s + ledger updates under load.
2. Monitor Fal balance burn rate vs credit pricing; adjust if Veo usage spikes.
3. Scope webhook signature verification + stuck-job monitor alert.
4. Review latest `aud` run (6 critical / 19 high findings) and plan remediation before scaling traffic.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- None blocking launch; Fal/Stripe keys confirmed and schemas current.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- Latest deployment: https://sora2-ugc-app-clean-9ubjpkihf-brandontans-projects.vercel.app (Fal webhook + dashboard preview fixes).
- `aud full --quiet` run (2025-10-16) flagged critical/high issues; follow-up required next shift.
