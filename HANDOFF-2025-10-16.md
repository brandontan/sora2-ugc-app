**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Ran takeover preflight: git repo validation, cleanliness check, tracked-secret scan.
  - Confirmed `Agents.md` Start Here pointers and logged Memory MCP reference.
  - Reviewed CLAUDE.MD failure log to keep schema and UX gaps top of mind.
- In progress:
  - Lining up spec-kit follow-up once jobs schema + queue UX work unblock.
- Blockers:
  - Supabase jobs schema still missing; webhook flow still lacks persistence columns.
  - Queue UX retains blocking overlay until redesign is delivered.
- Decisions:
  - No new decisions today; continuing prior guidance.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Operational readiness docs + handoff hygiene.
- Next immediate task: Prep spec-driven plan once cron + jobs schema tasks unblocked.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = danger-full-access
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Verify Fal webhook delivery (logs + Supabase updates) with cron poller still manual.
2. Draft spec-kit updates covering jobs schema and provider telemetry gaps.
3. Outline queue overlay redesign so users can submit while a job is pending.
4. Plan Auditor run after next deploy-ready change list.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Access to production Supabase to apply schema migrations for jobs + ledger tables.
- Confirmation of live API keys (Fal, Stripe) or placeholders for local tests.
- Status on domain transfer for genvidsfast.com.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- No deploy today; preflight only, waiting on schema + UX readiness.
