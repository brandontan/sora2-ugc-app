**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Ran takeover preflight, repo clean, no secret-pattern lines flagged.
  - Updated Agents.md Start Here to point at today's handoff and logged Memory MCP.
  - Reviewed CLAUDE.MD failures to keep schema + UX gaps visible.
  - Removed WaveSpeed provider support so `/api/sora` funnels all jobs through fal.ai.
  - Captured v0 storyboard + creative brief for Sora2 + Veo 3.1 concept wave ([v0 chat](https://v0.app/chat/m2ORTIaHxhs)).
  - Frontend/API now support per-model asset modes (single image, first+last frame, reference set) when launching Fal Veo 3.1 jobs.
  - Disabled scheduled poller; Fal webhooks now drive status updates (poller kept as manual fallback).
  - Job tray now remembers dismissed completed jobs across reloads via persisted timestamp threshold.
- In progress:
  - Monitor Fal webhook delivery health now that cron poller is disabled by default.
  - Prep spec-kit drop of v0 storyboard assets into roadmap tasks.
- Blockers:
  - Supabase jobs schema still missing; webhook-only flow still depends on those columns.
  - Queue UX remains blocking overlay until redesign lands.
- Decisions:
  - Keep mock tokens short in tests; avoid storing high-entropy placeholders going forward.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Operational readiness docs + handoff hygiene.
- Next immediate task: Prep spec-driven plan once cron + jobs schema tasks unblocked.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = danger-full-access
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Verify Fal webhook delivery (logs + Supabase updates) now that cron poller is manual-only.
2. Monitor job tray persistence; confirm users can re-show completed jobs as expected.
3. Draft spec updates for jobs schema + provider telemetry per spec-kit workflow.
4. Re-run Auditor after any deploy to keep critical list tracked.
5. Review queue overlay UX path and outline redesign steps.
6. Fold v0 storyboard notes into next spec-kit update.
7. Document new model-specific asset requirements in product/standards.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Access to production Supabase to apply schema migrations for jobs + ledger tables.
- Confirmation of live API keys (Fal, Stripe) or placeholders for local tests.
- Status on domain transfer for genvidsfast.com.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- No deploy today; wait on cron + schema readiness before pushing to genvidsfast.com.
