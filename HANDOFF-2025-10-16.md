**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Ran takeover preflight, repo clean, no secret-pattern lines flagged.
  - Updated Agents.md Start Here to point at today's handoff and logged Memory MCP.
  - Reviewed CLAUDE.MD failures to keep schema + UX gaps visible.
- In progress:
  - Waiting on cron schedule + admin telemetry workstreams noted in priorities.
- Blockers:
  - Supabase jobs schema still missing; cron wiring blocked on verified secrets.
  - Queue UX remains blocking overlay until redesign lands.
- Decisions:
  - Keep mock tokens short in tests; avoid storing high-entropy placeholders going forward.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Operational readiness docs + handoff hygiene.
- Next immediate task: Prep spec-driven plan once cron + jobs schema tasks unblocked.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = danger-full-access
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Confirm cron env secrets (`ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, `CRON_SECRET`, Fal key) before scheduling deploy.
2. Draft spec updates for jobs schema + provider telemetry per spec-kit workflow.
3. Re-run Auditor after any deploy to keep critical list tracked.
4. Review queue overlay UX path and outline redesign steps.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Access to production Supabase to apply schema migrations for jobs + ledger tables.
- Confirmation of live API keys (Fal, WaveSpeed, Stripe) or placeholders for local tests.
- Status on domain transfer for genvidsfast.com.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- No deploy today; wait on cron + schema readiness before pushing to genvidsfast.com.
