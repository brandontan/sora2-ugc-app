**Purpose:** Facilitate project hand-off
**DATE:** 2025-10-09
**PROJECT:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed: Added Supabase realtime listener so dashboard balance refreshes instantly after top-ups; Playwright config now respects live env vars so the live spec runs without manual edits; local E2E run passes with supplied automation creds.
- Blockers: Still missing confirmed seeded Supabase login to execute the live Playwright flow against production; no deploy performed yet because approval + access pending.
- Decisions: Keep Sora credit cost at 5 per generation, maintain `x-automation-secret` gate on testing endpoints, rely on `.env.local` for service role key instead of checking anything into git.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Verifying realtime balance behavior on production dashboard with the seeded QA account.
- Next immediate task: Re-run the live Playwright flow against production once the seeded credentials are confirmed.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://ylcseodxtwpxkeahrieb.supabase.co
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = configured via env (not committed)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = configured via env (not committed)
- AUTOMATION_SECRET = configured in env for testing endpoints
- SITE_URL = https://genvidsfast.com
- SORA_CREDIT_COST = 5 (default if env unset)

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Acquire/confirm Supabase QA credentials and rerun `npm run test:e2e -- live-genvidsfast.spec.ts` against production.
2. Monitor automation balance refresh in production and capture evidence for the handoff.
3. Kick off Vercel deploy once live automation is consistently green.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Need the canonical QA Supabase email/password and permission to deploy to production; policy warning copy guidelines still pending confirmation.
