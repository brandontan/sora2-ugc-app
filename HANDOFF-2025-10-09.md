**Purpose:** Facilitate project hand-off
**DATE:** 2025-10-09
**PROJECT:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed: initial repo commit; documented current state (Agents.md, MEMORY.md); verified local mock Playwright flow remains green.
- Blockers: Supabase admin/password APIs reject API keys when called from Node/Playwright, so automated prod login is impossible; without login we cannot hit Stripe or Sora in production.
- Decisions: hold deployment until Supabase exposes a usable session path (tested user or endpoint).

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: enabling programmatic Supabase login so live e2e can run.
- Next immediate task: retest `frontend/tests/e2e/live-genvidsfast.spec.ts` once Supabase returns a valid session.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://ylcseodxtwpxkeahrieb.supabase.co
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = stored locally (do not commit)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = stored locally (do not commit)
- SITE_URL = https://genvidsfast.com
- Stripe sandbox secret/price IDs configured locally for tests

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Obtain working Supabase session (fix API key issue or provide test account endpoint).
2. Run live Playwright flow end-to-end (login → Stripe → Sora download).
3. Deploy frontend to production after the live test passes.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Confirmation from Supabase/ops on how to authenticate automation (service key permissions or alternate login path).
- Any production deployment constraints once tests pass.
