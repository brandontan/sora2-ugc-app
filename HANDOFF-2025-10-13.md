**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Reviewed CLAUDE.MD failure log and captured critical warnings
  - Verified git status clean and ran tracked secret scan (no hits)
  - Synced Memory MCP pointer for current handoff reference
- Blockers:
  - None (waiting on execution approval for priority tasks)
- Decisions:
  - Keep existing Agents.md “Start Here” links (Memory MCP + HANDOFF-2025-10-13.md) as the single source

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: "Takeover checklist compliance and readiness for priority task execution"
- Next immediate task: "Plan implementation for cron poller + admin jobs telemetry once green-lit"

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = local takeover (no pending env updates)

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Schedule `/api/sora/poller?limit=5` cron using `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` (WaveSpeed + Fal coverage)
2. Build `/admin/jobs` telemetry dashboard (jobs table + provider timeline)
3. Unblock provider gaps: Fal `IN_QUEUE` jobs and Replicate Sora org verification

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Domain access for `genvidsfast.com` transfer/alias
- Provider support timelines (Fal queue clearing, Replicate org verification)
- Confirmation on production credential status for Fal/WaveSpeed

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- Pending fresh verification; reuse prior deployment checklist from HANDOFF-2025-10-12.md until reconfirmed
