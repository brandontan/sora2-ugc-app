**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Switched the Vercel cron schedule to run `/api/sora/poller` every five minutes and documented the required `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` + `CRON_SECRET` pairing.
  - Canonicalized provider statuses end-to-end (Next.js `/admin/jobs` + Streamlit dashboard) and aligned filter/chart data with the shared taxonomy.
  - Simplified the creator dashboard job tray per v0 guidance: preview/download only on completed jobs, retry for failed jobs, cancel for in-flight jobs, and refreshed the UI styles.
  - Tightened `/admin/jobs` legend vs. filter alignment and standardized the "User Cancelled" display.
  - Ran `pnpm lint` to validate the frontend changes.
- In progress:
  - Began pricing overhaul to set the credit pack at $20 for 75 credits and differentiate standard vs. Pro credit costs (5 vs. 7). API wiring updated; dashboard/UI and docs still need revisions before launch.
- Blockers:
  - Production deployment still pending genvidsfast.com domain transfer and cron env secret configuration; WaveSpeed job `6e4653cc-6d69-4004-821d-41b208b8d7e7` remains stuck waiting on provider response.
- Decisions:
  - Adopt canonical status vocabulary (`queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `user_cancelled`, `other`) across operator surfaces for consistency.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Automating poller reconciliation and keeping admin telemetry synchronized across surfaces.
- Next immediate task: Deploy latest changes (`next build` + Vercel prod) once secrets are in place and verify cron execution logs.
- Secondary TODO: finish pricing rollout (update frontend copy, ensure Stripe SKU reflects new pack price, audit credit ledger + refund logic).

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- cron schedule = `*/5 * * * *` targeting `/api/sora/poller`
- workspace mode = local takeover (env secrets still manual)

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Set `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` + `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel production and confirm cron invocations in logs.
2. Deploy updated `/admin/jobs` view and Streamlit dashboard; rerun Auditor post-deploy.
3. Follow up with WaveSpeed on stalled job `6e4653cc-...` and validate Fal queue drain after cron runs.
4. Complete pricing changes (update Stripe price IDs, adjust UI messaging, verify refunds with new credit differentials).

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Domain access for `genvidsfast.com` transfer or shared ownership to point the deployment.
- Confirmation of production secrets (`ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, `CRON_SECRET`, `FAL_KEY`, `WAVESPEED_API_KEY`).
- Provider SLA updates for WaveSpeed and Fal to diagnose long-running jobs.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- Build with `pnpm --filter frontend build` once secrets are staged, then `vercel deploy --prod` for project `sora2-ugc-app-clean`.
- After deploy, alias to `genvidsfast.com` once domain transfer completes and run TheAuditorTool security sweep.
