### UX FLOW NOTES (do not lose)
- Production flow: login → OTP → Stripe credit pack purchase → generate video via upload/provider/settings.
- After submit: job moves into thumbnail tray; user must stay unblocked to start more jobs; show status per thumbnail; play bell when job completes.
- Test dashboard exists because production currently broken; it must allow job start, minimize to tray, permit immediate reruns, and support WaveSpeed.ai + Fal.ai while credits remain.
- If credits insufficient/low, surface warning to top up; cancel outstanding jobs via API when balance gone.
