**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project:** PROJECT_NAME

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed: ["Takeover preflight (CLAUDE.MD, clean repo, secret scan)", "Created fresh Vercel project sora2-ugc-app-clean and linked frontend/", "Synced .env.local secrets to production/preview/development and shipped prod deploy https://sora2-ugc-app-clean-hl9sntgja-brandontans-projects.vercel.app"]
- Blockers: ["Cannot assign genvidsfast.com: Vercel CLI reports no access to domain under brandontans-projects", "Fal jobs remain IN_QUEUE even after poller runs", "Replicate Sora rejected key (org not verified) so no coverage yet"]
- Decisions: ["Keep new production project named sora2-ugc-app-clean with frontend/ root + node22", "Mirror runtime secrets 1:1 from .env.local across environments", "Hold domain cut-over until owner grants domain permissions or reassigns manually"]

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: "Stabilize new Vercel project + validate deployment story"
- Next immediate task: "Secure domain permissions so genvidsfast.com can target sora2-ugc-app-clean"

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- env = local takeover
- vercel_project = sora2-ugc-app-clean (prod URL above)

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. "Resolve access to genvidsfast.com and repoint to new deployment"
2. "Deploy poller cron against /api/sora/poller with ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN"
3. "Finalize /admin/jobs smoke test incl. event timeline"

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- ["Domain owner to grant access or reassign genvidsfast.com to sora2-ugc-app-clean", "Fal support on persistent IN_QUEUE state", "OpenAI org verification timeline for Sora access"]

### UX FLOW NOTES (do not lose)
- Production flow: login → OTP → Stripe credit pack purchase → generate video via upload/provider/settings.
- After submit: job moves into thumbnail tray; user must stay unblocked to start more jobs; show status per thumbnail; play bell when job completes.
- Test dashboard exists because production currently broken; it must allow job start, minimize to tray, permit immediate reruns, and support WaveSpeed.ai + Fal.ai while credits remain.
- If credits insufficient/low, surface warning to top up; cancel outstanding jobs via API when balance gone.
