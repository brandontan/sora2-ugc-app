**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Ran takeover preflight: verified clean git state and scanned tracked files for secret patterns.
  - Confirmed Start Here pointers and rolled handoff forward to HANDOFF-2025-10-14.md.
  - Rotated production `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` and `CRON_SECRET`; values stored locally at `~/.codex-os/secrets/2025-10-14-*.txt` for operators to migrate into secure vaults.
  - Deployed `sora2-ugc-app-clean-cz6bpp30w` with cron set to daily for Hobby compliance.
  - Dashboard now surfaces credit consumption per model (Sora2 = 5 credits/run, Pro = 7 credits/run) and updates low-balance warnings accordingly.
  - Removed retry button for failed jobs and added "Clear all" control to the job tray for faster cleanup during testing.
  - Simplified pricing to Sora-only runs; removed Sora Pro UI/API hooks to avoid loss-making tiers.
  - Logged Memory MCP with latest handoff reference for continuity.
- In progress:
  - None.
- Blockers:
  - Poller now scheduled daily (`0 0 * * *`) to stay within Vercel Hobby limits; need external scheduler or plan upgrade for 5-minute cadence.
  - Vercel rejected `genvidsfast.com`; domain tied to another project and must be transferred before aliasing.
- Decisions:
  - None today; continuing existing priorities.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Maintain takeover hygiene and ensure handoff artifacts stay current.
- Next immediate task: Resume priority queue telemetry work once ownership continues.
- Secondary TODO: Monitor cron scheduling readiness (needs secrets + deployment).

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = local takeover (danger-full-access)
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Stand up external scheduler (GitHub Action/Supabase function) or upgrade plan to restore 5-minute polling cadence.
2. Progress `/admin/jobs` telemetry view per roadmap.
3. Investigate provider gaps (Fal queue drain, Replicate org verification).

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Access to production secrets and provider status updates.
- Confirmation on cron deployment readiness.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- Cron file updated to `0 0 * * *` for Hobby compliance; production deploy `sora2-ugc-app-clean-cz6bpp30w` succeeded.
- When external scheduler or plan upgrade ready, revert to `*/5 * * * *`, redeploy (`vercel deploy --prod --yes`), and rerun Auditor.
