**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Ran takeover preflight: verified clean git state and scanned tracked files for secret patterns.
  - Confirmed Start Here pointers and rolled handoff forward to HANDOFF-2025-10-14.md.
  - Logged Memory MCP with latest handoff reference for continuity.
- In progress:
  - None.
- Blockers:
  - Production secrets for cron + providers still outstanding per prior notes.
- Decisions:
  - None today; continuing existing priorities.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Maintain takeover hygiene and ensure handoff artifacts stay current.
- Next immediate task: Resume priority queue telemetry work once ownership continues.
- Secondary TODO: Monitor cron scheduling readiness (needs secrets + deployment).

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = local takeover (danger-full-access)
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Reconfirm cron secret provisioning and schedule activation.
2. Progress `/admin/jobs` telemetry view per roadmap.
3. Investigate provider gaps (Fal queue drain, Replicate org verification).

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Access to production secrets and provider status updates.
- Confirmation on cron deployment readiness.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- No new deploy today; next deploy should rerun Auditor post-push when feature work lands.
