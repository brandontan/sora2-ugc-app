**Purpose:** Facilitate project hand-off
**DATE:** 2025-10-10
**PROJECT:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed: Swapped landing page to chaotic-video hero with concise copy; simplified auth card messaging; removed workflow button; refreshed dashboard styling; redeployed production site; updated Agents guide with working agreement.
- Blockers: Need updated Supabase QA credentials for live Playwright run; pricing strategy pending for final copy; Gemini Veo 3.1 integration requirements still unspecified.
- Decisions: Keep landing minimal (hero + email link); continue deploying directly to genvidsfast.com after successful local validation.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Stabilizing end-to-end flow with new UI and prepping future model support.
- Next immediate task: Run production Playwright suite once QA credentials and pricing direction arrive.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://thmsrumxinyjyljdgcgy.supabase.co

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Lock revised pricing/value offer and update UI copy accordingly.
2. Configure roadmap for Gemini Veo 3.1 support alongside Sora2.
3. Execute live Playwright flow with confirmed QA credentials and capture evidence.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Pricing guidance for credit packs vs. per-run billing.
- Official Supabase QA credentials + automation secret for production tests.
- Product requirements for Gemini Veo 3.1 rollout.
