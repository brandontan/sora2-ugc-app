**Purpose:** Facilitate project hand-off
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed: ["Dashboard now switches controls per provider (fal.ai vs WaveSpeed) with duration, aspect, and resolution/size selectors", "Queued job UX shows provider slug + selected model", "API accepts model + aspect ratio so Sora2 Pro hits the right queue", "ESLint clean on dashboard file"]
- Blockers: []
- Decisions: ["Keep Wavespeed submission routed via existing FAL job starter until partner endpoint/keys arrive"]

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: "Verify dashboard UX locally; plan E2E coverage for provider toggles"
- Next immediate task: "Update Playwright full-flow spec to exercise provider switch + balance guard"

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- Default provider fal.ai (auto resolution) Â· Wavespeed sizes keyed by aspect ratio

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. "Extend tests to submit both provider paths and assert payload"
2. "Plumb actual WaveSpeed endpoint once credentials/contract land"
3. "Confirm margin math still accurate when Sora2 Pro is chosen"

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- ["WaveSpeed API docs + keys for production integration", "Confirmation on credit cost uplift (if any) for Sora2 Pro so copy/tests stay honest"]
