**Purpose:** Facilitate project hand-off
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed: ["Captured failure analysis in claude.md for next agent", "Verified fal.ai queue API manually via curl, confirmed completion workflow"]
- Blockers: ["Production Supabase instance lacks required jobs/ledger tables", "Dashboard still blocks subsequent submissions while a job is queuing", "Provider metadata not persisted in storage"]
- Decisions: ["Do not trust existing job-tracking claims until schema is rebuilt", "Hold WaveSpeed integration work until Supabase schema and queue UX are fixed"]

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: "Rebuild Supabase schema (profiles, credit_ledger, jobs, provider metadata) and expose via REST"
- Next immediate task: "Redesign dashboard queue overlay to allow multiple submissions without full-screen block"

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- Fal key available for testing; WaveSpeed/OpenAI integrations not wired
- Local .env contains service-role key and Supabase URL but schema is missing tables

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. "Apply supabase/schema.sql (or equivalent) to thmsrumxinyjyljdgcgy project and confirm tables exist"
2. "Persist provider_status/queue_position/provider_last_checked columns and update API accordingly"
3. "Modify dashboard to show non-blocking queue state and verify with manual test"
4. "After schema + UX fixes, plan WaveSpeed integration implementation"

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- ["Confirmation that Supabase migrations can be applied (access to SQL editor or deployment pipeline)", "Design decision on how to persist queued job metadata", "WaveSpeed API credentials once foundation is solid"]
