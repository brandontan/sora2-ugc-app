**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Ran takeover preflight: confirmed git repo clean and scanned tracked files with tightened secret regex.
  - Reaffirmed `Agents.md` Start Here pointers and captured latest handoff in Memory MCP (`mcp://memory/sora2-ugc-app/handoff`).
  - Issued new daily handoff note (`HANDOFF-2025-10-15.md`) and preserved 2025-10-14 context.
- In progress:
  - None.
- Blockers:
  - Need production scheduler plan for `/api/sora/poller?limit=5` cadence > daily to meet roadmap priority.
- Decisions:
  - None today.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Maintain takeover hygiene; prep runway for telemetry work.
- Next immediate task: Resume `/admin/jobs` telemetry view build once development cycle restarts.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = danger-full-access
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Choose scheduler path (external cron vs. plan upgrade) for 5-minute poller.
2. Continue `/admin/jobs` telemetry view progress with provider timeline evidence.
3. Unblock provider gaps (Fal queue drain, Replicate org verification).

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Confirmation of production secrets (`ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, `CRON_SECRET`, `FAL_KEY`, `WAVESPEED_API_KEY`).
- Updated status on plan upgrade or external scheduler availability.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- No new deploy today; last verified deploy: `sora2-ugc-app-clean-idd0za60b` (cron set to `0 0 * * *`).
- Next deploy should include cron adjustment + Auditor run once scheduler decision made.
