**Purpose:** Takeover readiness log
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Project:** sora2-ugc-app

### TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Completed:
  - Implemented per-job video aspect detection on dashboard preview; caches ratio by job id from metadata.
  - Removed out-of-component hooks lint issue; eslint clean via `pnpm --filter frontend lint`.
  - Persisted Memory MCP note for takeover thread (`mcp://memory/sora2-ugc-app/handoff`).
  - Added secure download handler that fetches video blob client-side to avoid new-tab navigation.
- In progress:
  - Confirm Fal webhook ingestion + Supabase writes once polling pipeline settles (pending test job).
- Blockers:
  - Preflight flagged tracked Stripe config strings (`frontend/src/lib/stripe.ts`, `frontend/playwright.config.ts`, `frontend/src/app/api/credits/checkout/route.ts`)â€”need audit before release.
- Decisions:
  - Continue relying on runtime video metadata as SSOT for preview orientation until jobs table stores aspect ratio.

### CURRENT FOCUS
- Working on: Dashboard UX accuracy (preview orientation + tray behavior).
- Next immediate task: Verify Fal webhook delivery updates Supabase rows before wiring admin telemetry timeline.

### ACTIVE CONFIGURATIONS
- branch = main
- workspace mode = danger-full-access
- approval_policy = never

### TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES
1. Validate Fal webhook -> Supabase ingestion with fresh job + log capture.
2. Re-test clear-all tray logic against admin dashboard refresh loop.
3. Plan cron deployment path for `/api/sora/poller?limit=5`.

### CONTEXT NEEDED
- Confirm production secrets inventory (`ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, `CRON_SECRET`, `FAL_KEY`, `WAVESPEED_API_KEY`).
- Need clarity on Stripe live key handling path post-security review.

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- No new deploy today; last verified deploy: `sora2-ugc-app-clean-idd0za60b` (cron set to `0 0 * * *`).
- Next deploy should include cron adjustment + Auditor run once scheduler decision made.
